        <p class= "p3">Finding the perfect new member of your family can be overwhelming, especially when there are so many things to consider, like your own lifestyle, 
     the kind of pet you want, and how to care for your pet and give it a long and healthy life.</p>

        <p class= "p3">We wanted to do an analysis against other products to see what inspirations we can take away and gaps we can fill in.</p>

    <div id="Questions">
        <p class= "p3">I recall spending so much time doing research online for which pet to get. And many of them have differing ideas of which pet is the best 
          for you. Maybe a more streamline guide could help folks with getting a pet. We got the idea to do a questionnaire to sort out the best match for someone. 
          When we tried to implement the idea we realized that maybe it was too complicated in that it would make our app less streamline. We also thought that we 
          could run into issues if our users were unhappy with the breed they were recommended.</p>

    <div id="WireframeSearch">
        <p class= "p3">We figured we could shift our focus unto connecting people, similar to facebook but targeted for pet ownership. Our goal was to provide users
          with more guidance for the process of finding and adopting a pet to alleviate the complexities and uncertainties of navigating the process, especially 
          for first-time pet owners. So, we decided to focus the app on making meetups and adoptions.</p>

        <p class= "p3">Once finding a pet, giving users access and exposure to a community of other pet owners allows them to grow their knowledge 
          and satisfaction in owning a pet.</p>
