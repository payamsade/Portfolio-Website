                <p class= "p3">I recall spending so much time doing research online for which pet to get. And many of them have differing ideas of which pet is the best 
                  for you. Maybe a more streamline guide could help folks with getting a pet. We got the idea to do a questionnaire to sort out the best match for someone. 
                  When we tried to implement the idea we realized that maybe it was too complicated in that it would make our app less streamline. We also thought that we 
              could run into issues if our users were unhappy with the breed they were recommended.</p>

            <p class= "p3">We figured we could shift our focus unto connecting people, similar to facebook but targeted for pet ownership. Our goal was to provide users
              with more guidance for the process of finding and adopting a pet to alleviate the complexities and uncertainties of navigating the process, especially 
          for first-time pet owners. So, we decided to focus the app on making meetups and adoptions.</p>
