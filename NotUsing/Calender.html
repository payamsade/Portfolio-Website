However, the competitive audit does not paint the bigger picture. While most apps check all boxes for different features, each app carries out feature performance to a different level.

In moving forward with our redesign, it would be more productive to take two courses of action:
Choose an entirely new feature for Google Calendar to include in our redesign
Improve an existing feature that was identified in our user research as having a tedious workflow</p>

                   <p class= "p33W">This flow is typical for a user who wants to check out his schedule at a given moment of the day with the red path indicating primary interaction and the green path indicating alternative interaction.  He first opens the app, which asks him either to login to his existing Google account or to sign up for a totally new one.

                  <p class= "p33W">The entry point is the homepage after login. The rectangle is the interface. The rhombus is the users’ possible actions. Yellow ones are newly added features.
    The group feature allows users to add or edit their groups. Once the user joins a group, a new button will be added to his homepage, which allows him to switch from the single model (default) to the group model. In the group model, every group members’ schedule will be integrated into a common calendar. Users are able to check and comment on each other's schedules, chat, or turn off the notification. Group members can post their to-do events  for a period of time in the group common calendar, and mark the expected completion time. In addition, they can also set reminders for to-dos.
    This new feature aims to improve collaboration and communication between users. Switchable notifications and group models also prevent users from being distrubed by overwhelming messages.

                <p class= "p3W">Design Inspiration:
We run our app through a standard login and sign up screen. We then offer the user different views of their week and schedule. We offer many points in which they can interact with and change their events. In our event creator we laid out many ways in which users can design and specify their events, with time, location, etc. We found inspiration from Google Calendar and Apple calendar’s existing features. We thought it’d be good to have similar mockups from our UI sketches. Our prototypes take on different solutions for a calendar app. One employs group functions, the other uses a traditional setup. Really the designs should be used in tandem, but maybe we want to see if users find the group function useful from the control. We thought a traditional layout was the way to go since most people are already familiar with them. We found it useful to have more options by scrolling down as we thought that it enhances user convenience. Lastly, though we intend to change our Login/set-up screen, we found it hard to argue against a change to the standard version.

            <p class= "p4W">Prototype Differences:</p>
            <p class= "p3W">Both prototypes explore different features, which is productive as a design strategy. Prototype A focused on calendar/daily view features while prototype B focused on collaborative features. In essence, our low-fidelity prototypes take actionable steps towards accomplishing aspects of our problem statement. We aim to maximize efficiency for working class professionals who use digital calendar apps.

It is important to note the stark difference in prototype purpose. This way we can work on refining our high-fidelity prototype to combine prospective features from either prototype.

Users found it difficult to interact with the UI. This made way for a series of issues. Completing tasks was hard because they thought the information visible in the UI copy was cluttered and not salient.
Users recognized that the use of color could have gone a long way in making certain interactions intuitive. Including color would have contributed to the overall saliency of the prototype’s affordances.

An obvious issue users had in interacting with this prototype is that students could not view the full scope of the prototype in the phone screen.
This implies that we could have improved the prototype overall by resizing so that it fit the medium of the Iphone layout in the interactive view mode.
 Users also expressed that including a grid underlay of some sort so that the app screens themselves resembled a calendar app would have provided a smoother experience.

<p class= "p33W">Use prototype B as a basis for developing our high-fidelity prototype for the next milestone. </p>
<p class= "p33W">We want to do this because we believe that users deserve to use digital apps in novel ways. Expanding a collaborative workflow in google calendar would engage users and make their tasks all the much easier to accomplish. This is the core of our design idea.</p>
<p class= "p33W">Including sharing features in a future prototype would satisfy users who expressed the ability to share as a pain point in our earlier milestones.</p>

                  <p class= "p33W">Our Hi-Fi prototype implements our UX flow 1 and 2 from milestone 3. We changed the layout of our top navigation buttons to maintain consistency for the user interface and to make the layout cleaner. We added a dropdown for the month view in order to quickly shift months in any view. We kept concepts from both previous UX flows, blending them to create a very useful interface. Allowing group usage and smooth navigation of dates and event views. We learned in user testing that the main features that were wanted were group usage and a more sleek calendar view. From the point of view of the user we saw a need to morph both concepts on one screen with a side view and simple tabs to navigate through features.</p>

The chat feature seems very odd for a calendar app. Can get really annoying if you’re just getting berated with messages for scheduling.
Doesn’t like how the group schedule page is set up (pg 9). Feels it is redundant.
Maybe a free-time section would be more appropriate than someone’s entire schedule.

We found that all of our users like the general interface of the app and the idea of implementing the group calendar function. Nevertheless, while the group calendar is a solid idea that enables organizing and collaborating between users, we learned that it is still missing quite a lot of features to be considered properly functional.

Notably, we need a feature that allows group members to continue to add more users after the group is created and another feature which allows sending out links to video calls for group meetings. We also need to reevaluate the group members schedule feature, since it is both difficult to access and can compromise personal privacy if a user does not want to disclose his own schedule. Furthermore, we need to refine our icons so that users have a better idea intuitively what they do without spending too much time experimenting.

In our final prototype, we allow users to add more users to previously created groups. We also proofread the prototype to make sure all the screens dropdown menu selection and respective calendars match. Moreover, we removed the toggle ability for the “notification” button.
